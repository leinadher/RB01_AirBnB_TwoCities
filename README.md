#### Inside AirBnB Data Study Case: Barcelona

## General notes
- The main project is 'project01.R'.

- The data sets are stored in the 'Data' folder.

- The R file automatically creates data frames associated to variables from the contents of the Data folder, as long as they have a 'listings.csv' file.

- The R working directory (wd) is configured to be the directory of the file itself, and will look for the data sets there.
